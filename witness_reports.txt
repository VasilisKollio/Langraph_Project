--- Witness Report #1 ---
Time: Around 08:03 AM
Location: Corner of Main St. and 3rd Avenue

"I was walking my dog when I noticed a big blue truck rushing past the gas station — it looked like it was going way too fast. It had a dark tarp over the back, and I remember the plate started with GTR or something similar. It almost hit a red light and kept going. Just didn’t look right."


--- Witness Report #2 ---
Time: About 08:04 AM
Location: Parking lot by the convenience store

"A blue or dark-colored truck went through the intersection too quickly. I heard tires screeching — like it braked suddenly. I couldn't read the whole license plate, but I caught something like GT_ or G7_. It had something loaded in the back, covered. I think it was a commercial truck."


--- Witness Report #3 ---
Time: 08:05 AM
Location: Near the city bus stop on Main

"There was a white bus stopped in front of me for about 10 seconds, blocking the pedestrian crossing. The driver looked nervous, checking the mirror a lot. There was no one getting off, which seemed odd. The plate had '4410' or something close to it. It drove off quickly after that."


--- Witness Report #4 ---
Time: 08:06 AM
Location: Behind the bakery (side alley)

"I noticed a black car parked awkwardly behind the bakery. It had tinted windows and looked like someone was inside, waiting. It was there when I arrived just before 8, and still there when I left a few minutes after 8:06. I didn’t catch the full plate but think it ended in 34 — maybe RAN-1234?"
